# Computer Science Cookbook!

A cookbook of various things that I've implemented that are interesting to me! I hope you enjoy them as much as I do :))

I really enjoyed my Algorithms course (CS170), so here I am making a toolbox of various algorithms. Maybe someday I'll find the time to go back through all of the homeworks and implement all of the solutions. Some of the implementations are wholly unnecessary (as you might find) e.g. `lib/matrix.py` and `numpy`, but I enjoyed implementing them nonetheless, so I can get a feel of what an implementation might look like. Some of the implementations might be in pursuit of efficiency; others in pursuit of the least lines of code. 

This also includes a small aggregation of the interesting bits of code that came as a result of CS189 and EECS127 at UC Berkeley. Credit is due where credit is due. 

I've done a lot of coding practice problems (or whatever they're called) on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/bri25yu/), so someday I may want to (selfishly) take some of my favorite problems and their respective solutions and make some sort of question bank. 

Now, I can't promise that all of the code here is pristine; in fact, I know that at the very least it's missing many many tests and documentation. In fact, I'm currently aware of several existing design bugs; I suppose if you're really invested you can report them to this [repo's issues](https://github.com/bri25yu/Computer-Science-Cookbook/issues). However confident I am of my own code is most likely unable to be transferred, especially without the credibility of testing throughout, but I really just hope that you can find some enjoyment reading through this code like I did when it was being implemented! 

I supposed in one sense you can sort of think of this as a curriculum vitae (I spell it out here to avoid confusion with other 'cv' abbreviations, such as 'computer vision' or 'curried vegetables'), but (and perhaps egocentrically) I don't think that it comes close to encapsulating all of the things that I've done and experienced. I do think, however, that you'll at least be able to get a sense of what sorts of things in the computer science world excite me and how excited I am by computer science. 

**Disclaimer**: I've taken special care to try to minimize the amount of potential "solutions" I'm giving away in this cookbook, mostly by rewriting all of any skeleton/starter code in my own fashion (whether that's a blessing or a curse, that's up to you). If you think some things are violating the UC Berkeley educational code of conduct, please feel free to reach out to me over [email](bri25yu@berkeley.edu) or visit my [personal website](bri25yu.github.io). 

Happy coding!
